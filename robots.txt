# | 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow  |
# |    a human being to come to harm.                                    |
# |                                                                      |
# | 2) A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except  |
# |    where such orders would conflict with the First Law.              |
# |                                                                      |
# | 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection |
# |    does not conflict with the First or Second Law.                   |
# |                                                                      |
